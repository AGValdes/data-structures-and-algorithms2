# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array and returns an array that is reversed. 

## Approach & Efficiency
First we identify and store the first and last values of the array, then inside of a while loop we store the original value in a temporary variable, and swap the values of the first and last items. We then increment the starting index and decriment the ending index in order to switch the entire array.
