## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array and a value and returns a new array the with the value inserted as the center index.

## Approach & Efficiency
First we capture our inputs, then find the length of the incoming array. Using that we determine it's midpoint. We then use a for loop over the first values leading up to the midpoint, copying the values from the old array into the new one. We then assign the middle value as the inputted number. we do a second for loop to copy the remaining values after the midpoint and then return the new array when finished.

## Solution
Hopefully it works this time!
